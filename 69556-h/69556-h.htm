of Medical Evidence.</em></h2>

<hr class="r5">

<p>Every legally qualified and registered
medical practitioner in actual practice
in or near the place where the death in
question happened, by the Coroners
Act, 1887, may be summoned by the
Coroner to give medical evidence as to
the cause of that death. Thus medical
men may be compelled to practise
medical jurisprudence if called upon so
to do. With the growth of knowledge
and exact observation, the weight which
is attached to medical evidence has
increased proportionately. It is still
true, however, that “the exercise of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
sound judgment, which is of far more
value in medico-legal matters than all
the substance of all the ancient <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">medicina
forensis</i>, must be our guide.”</p>

<p>The <b>Coroner’s Court</b> differs from
other tribunals in that, primarily, it
conducts an enquiry to which there are
no formal parties. The evidence received
by this Court is on that account
much less bound by technical rules.</p>

<hr class="r5">
<h3><span class="smcap">Classes of Medical Evidence
and Witnesses.</span></h3>

<p><em>The evidence of</em></p>

<p><b>I. Common witnesses of Facts
which they have observed.</b> They
state the minor premiss of the forensic
argument. Those who can describe
technical matters which they have seen
are <em>skilled common witnesses</em>: medical
men usually appear in court as skilled
witnesses. Job’s “I shall see for myself,
and my own eyes shall behold, and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
another,” indicates the correct attitude
of a common witness of fact.</p>


<p><em>The testimony of</em></p>

<p><b>II. Expert witnesses concerning
their Opinions.</b> They state the major
premiss of the syllogism, whose conclusion
is found in the verdict of the jury.
All expert witnesses should be skilled
witnesses. Experts sometimes become
common witnesses when examined as to
exhibits produced in court. The weakness
of expert testimony is, in practice,
its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</i> nature. Medical men called
to give evidence as to fact, must beware
of being unconsciously drawn into offering
expert testimony.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="I_PREPARING_AND_GIVING">I. PREPARING AND GIVING
EVIDENCE.</h2>
</div>


<h3><b>A. BEFORE ENTERING COURT.</b></h3>

<p>Notify directly to the Coroner all
deaths, the certificate of the cause of
which you are unable to sign (persons
found dead—whose death was caused or
hastened by accident or injury—who
have died without recent medical attendance—who,
although attended by a
registered medical practitioner during
the last illness, have died in such a
manner or at such a time, that the
medical man is unable to assign a cause
of natural death, or for some good reason
declines to certify the cause).</p>

<p>Most of the cases in which you give
medical evidence are those in which
you have declined to sign a certificate
of the cause of death.</p>

<p>There are also those cases in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the relatives object to your treatment,
and those in which the registrar refers
your certificate to the Coroner.</p>

<p>The fact that the account for professional
services rendered is likely to be
unpaid is <b>not</b> a good reason for refusing
to sign a death certificate.</p>

<p><b>Decline to give medical certificates</b>
to police-constables or to solicitors’
clerks gratuitously, and without
authority being shown.</p>

<p>Demand a formal interview by appointment
during professional hours with a
responsible superior; otherwise you
may receive no fees.</p>

<p>Volunteer no private information, and
express no opinion in public, concerning
medico-legal causes with which you are
not personally concerned; otherwise you
may be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub-pœna’d</i> to support your
views. If you know facts which will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
aid the execution of justice, give a <b>hint
to the police</b> either yourself or by a
medical friend.</p>

<p>Give information <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i> or in
letters marked “private.” Never write
an unofficial opinion. “Do right, and
don’t write—then fear nothing.”</p>

<p>Should you receive threatening letters,
demanding blackmail, or otherwise without
reasonable cause, at once put them
into a good solicitor’s hands. “Let
this action be a lesson for all men to
stand boldly forward—to stand on their
character—and not, by compromising
a present difficulty, to accumulate imputations
on their honour.” Associate
yourself permanently with a Medical
Defence Society.</p>

<p>Unless in self-protection, or at the
request of patients, do not appear in
court without having been properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
served with a formal <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub-pœna</i>.</p>

<p>Do not fail to attend after receiving a
formally served <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub-pœna</i>, on peril of
contempt of court and an action for
resulting damages on the part of the
litigant calling you as a witness. You
need not afford a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">precis</i> of your evidence.
“He [or they] must be satisfied with
impromptu answers.” When in doubt
or difficulty, seek at once the best legal
advice possible.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Escape Attending as a
Witness</span>:</h3>

<p><b>In Coroners’ Courts.</b> Written certificates
are usually accepted in Coroners’
Courts from members of hospital staffs
and from general practitioners concerning
the absence from ill-health of
witnesses or jurymen; the nature of the
illness need not be specified. In higher
Courts personal attendance and evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
upon oath are necessary.</p>

<p><b>In Civil Courts.</b> If an appeal to the
solicitor fails, you may state that your
memory of the events in question is
vague, and when prompted you may
find that the facts as known to you are
quite hostile to his client’s claim.</p>

<p>You may decline to offer “<b>expert
opinions</b>”—a direct interference with
the facts and circumstances of the case
alone <b>qualifies</b> you as a common skilled
witness who is bound to give evidence if
required so to do.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Preparation of Evidence.</span></h3>

<p>“More mistakes are made, many
more, by not looking than by not knowing.”
You must be ready to meet an
<b>exhaustive interrogation</b> in Court:
hence it is essential that a careful clinical
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> examination should
be made, with the aid of all reasonable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
modern apparatus, and that what is
known professionally concerning the
matters in hand should be revised from
modern text-books: your knowledge of
pathology must be up-to-date. “You
must know a thing before you suspect
it, and you must suspect a thing before
you find it.”</p>

<p><b>Remember</b> you are not a partisan:
value accuracy of observation and of
statement as you do your professional
reputation.</p>

<p>You must be prepared to <b>explain
facts and conclusions clearly</b> to a
body of laymen.</p>

<p><b>Beware</b> of mistaking a previously
formed inference for a recollection of
actual fact—assumed conclusions sometimes
fallaciously suggest the real cause.
“The chambermaid, in the background,
made out as much of the letter as she
could, and invented the rest; believing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
it all from that time forth as a positive
piece of evidence.” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stat pro ratione
voluntas</i> is a fallacy to be guarded
against.</p>

<p>Welcome, and even suggest, <b>conferences</b>
which will avoid subsequent
public differences in medical opinions.</p>

<p>Decide what exhibits and sketches
you will hand in. Label, initial, and
number them. If they are returned to
you after the trial, preserve them for
possible future use (e.g., pathological
specimens).</p>

<p>Previous to the trial keep all notes
and exhibits <b>under lock and key</b>.</p>

<p><b>Remember</b> medico-legal evidence is
subject to certain <b>limitations</b>—your
“facts” may be absolute, or probable,
or merely possible (see p. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>).</p>

<p><b>Refresh the memory</b> from your
clinical or other notes just before giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
evidence rather than when in the
witness box.</p>

<p>Any <b>notes read in the witness box</b>
are open to the inspection of the Court.
They must have been made by you at
the time of the event in question, or
immediately thereafter.</p>

<p>All clinical notes and personal memoranda
should be destroyed upon the
death of a medical practitioner, who
should see that his Will contains such
a direction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Medico-legal Examination of
the Living, the Dying, and
the Dead.</span></h3>

<p>“The best memory is a record <b>made
at the time</b>.”</p>

<p><b>Make a note on the spot</b> as to the
person examined, the place, the date,
and hour of the commencement of
the examination. Daylight should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
chosen.</p>

<p>If possible, choose a time such that
you can complete the enquiry at one
sitting, as it may be final.</p>

<p>Where criminal charges may arise,
<b>associate the police</b> (and, when
necessary, the relieving officer) with the
case at once. If called by a police-constable,
do not fail to note down his
number (from his collar).</p>

<p><b>Decline</b> to perform technical processes
which are probably beyond your skill:
thus the Coroner will usually secure
the permission of the County Council
for analyses in suspected poison cases.</p>

<p><b>Exclude lawyers and curious laymen</b>,
but invite another medical man,
especially if your own previous actions
may be in question.</p>

<p>Whatever you discover must be <b>kept
secret</b> until you give evidence in court.
As a matter of courtesy, the Coroner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
may be informed privately, before the
inquest is held, of any unexpected or
grave results; do not, however, inform
press men.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Medical Examination of the
Living and of the Dying,
for the Purpose of
Evidence.</span></h3>

<p>All persons examined physically
<b>must be informed</b> of, and <b>consent</b> to,
the purpose and possible legal consequences.</p>

<p>Never take directions from a third
person (e.g., police, magistrate, employer).</p>

<p>If a <b>further examination</b> may be
necessary (e.g., under an anæsthetic),
that fact should be stated.</p>

<p><b>Witnesses</b> should be present, especially
in the case of the examination of
females.</p>

<p><b>Do not send written certificates</b><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
to third persons as to the result of the
examination, unless (1) In an open
envelope, having read the certificate to
the patient who takes it to its destination;
(2) After having received the
written consent of the patient so to do.</p>

<p>The payment of the fee by a third
person does not absolve from the rule of
professional secrecy.</p>

<p>The symptoms and <b>feelings of a
patient</b> are sometimes admitted as
(hearsay) testimony from a medical witness,
especially where the former is
dead. <b>Letters</b> from a patient to a
medical man containing such statements
are not allowed.</p>

<p>A <b>confession</b> (which must be quite
voluntary) or a <b>dying declaration</b>
(from the lips of a victim of homicide
convinced of impending death) made in
the hearing of a medical man should be
noted down at once, word for word, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
in the absence of a magistrate, signed
by all persons present. Should death
be imminent after a criminal assault
(which includes abortion), the medical
man should urge the victim to make
such a dying declaration.</p>

<p>If a patient is sent to gaol or an
asylum, communicate at once, but
privately, with the medical officer
should you know of any <b>mental or
physical abnormality</b>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Examination of the Dead.</span></h3>

<p><b>Do not order the removal</b> of a
dead body; leave that duty to the police
or to the Coroner’s officer.</p>

<p><b>Forbid</b>, however, any disturbance of
a body to which you are called until you
have seen it and the circumstances.</p>

<p>1. Where the Coroner orders “evidence
touching the external appearance
of the body, and the cause of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
death”:</p>

<p>The body should be identified in your
presence; if it cannot be identified,
special care must be taken with the
inspection. A photograph should be
taken at once.</p>

<p>The appearance of the corpse, both
when clothed and when stripped, must
be noted.</p>

<p>In all cases the probable time of the
death must be estimated.</p>

<p>The presence and nature of parasites
must be recorded.</p>

<p>Should the cause of death still <b>remain
obscure</b> after a complete inspection,
the Coroner should be informed of
the fact and requested to order an
anatomical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> examination of
the body.</p>

<p>2. Where the Coroner orders a <b>full
post-mortem examination</b>, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
<p>“You are required to make or assist in
making a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> examination of the
body, which shall comprise an examination of
the viscera of the head, chest, and abdomen,
and, if necessary, an analysis of the contents
of the stomach, and report thereon at the
said inquest.” As to the analysis, see the
Home Office Circular (Jan. 7, 1903).</p>
</div>

<p>The body must not be opened until
the Coroner’s order has been received;
apart from inquests the <b>consent of
relatives</b> must be secured before a
body is dissected.</p>

<p>Wherever manslaughter or murder
is suspected, the Coroner will order a
necropsy as a matter of course.</p>

<p>If the deceased’s friends <b>charge you
with negligence</b> in treatment, you
must not conduct the examination.</p>

<p>Do not commence <b>until the body is
cold</b>; do not delay until marked putrefaction
has set in.</p>

<p>Have all necessary appliances at hand;
having once started <b>do not leave the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
room</b> until your final note has been
made and signed.</p>

<p>Do not employ a hammer or a chisel.</p>

<p><b>Remember</b> that it is dangerous to
attend lying-in women after making an
autopsy.</p>

<p>If the mortuary attendant does the
manual work you must watch each step.</p>

<p>If portions of organs are retained for
subsequent examination, have the fact
witnessed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Drawing up a Medico-legal
Report.</span></h3>

<p>In most cases the witness must recite
the report in open court.</p>

<p>For a complete investigation three
sets of facts must be collated:</p>

<p>1. The details of the environment of
the corpse, when and where first seen.</p>

<p>2. The personality and personal history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of the deceased.</p>

<p>3. The result of an exhaustive external
and internal <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> examination.</p>


<p><em>a. The Manner of the Report</em>:</p>

<p>Reports should be <b>short</b> and <b>distinct</b>;
all unnecessary words should be
omitted.</p>

<p>The paragraphs should be numbered:
this facilitates reference.</p>

<p>Names and figures must be written
plainly, and underlined.</p>

<p><b>Technical terms</b> should be used
only if the report is intended for the
use of a public authority; if used otherwise
they should be explained.</p>

<p><b>Beware</b> of writing “There is no ...”
when you intend to report “I can find
no....”</p>

<p>Exclude uncalled-for reasons, opinions,
and comments.</p>

<p>“Science is measurement.” Everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
that can be, should be <b>measured</b>.
Anatomical and chronological order and
exactness should be aimed at.</p>

<p>For immediate comparison, quote
easily recognized English standards.</p>

<p>“The <em>sometimes</em> of the cautious is
the <em>often</em> of the sanguine, the <em>always</em> of
the empiric, the <em>never</em> of the sceptic:
but the numbers 1, 10, 100, 1000 have
but one meaning for all mankind.”</p>

<p>In important cases the report should
be type-written in duplicate and signed,
one copy being handed to the Court.</p>


<p><em>b. The Matter of the Report</em>:</p>

<p>The date and time of day of each
examination, and the names of all persons
present thereat, should be stated.</p>

<p>There must be a very sharp division
made between:</p>

<p>(a) <b>Information</b> received and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
whom—this is hearsay.</p>

<p>“Never believe what a patient says
another doctor said.”</p>

<p>Never sign a certificate to oblige
another practitioner, without personally
examining the patient.</p>

<p>(b) <b>Facts</b> found by personal examination
or under personal supervision.</p>

<p>The results of a complete methodical
external (anterior and posterior) and
internal investigation must be detailed;
the condition of the <b>diseased organs</b>
may be recorded first, the <b>healthy
organs</b> being mentioned after, exhaustively.</p>

<p>After entering all the pertinent facts,
summarize the <b>main points</b>, and conclude
with the <b>probable cause</b> of the
pathological conditions found.</p>

<p><b>Sign</b> the report, affixing your medical
qualifications and the date; secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the signature of other medical men who
may be present. While in your care,
keep the report under lock and key.</p>

<p>Append any <b>sketches</b> or <b>photographs</b>,
carefully numbered, which
elucidate the case.</p>

<p>Retain an identical copy of the report
for reference.</p>
<hr class="r5">

<h3><b>B. WHEN IN COURT</b>,<br>
<span class="smcap">Before Being “Sworn.”</span></h3>

<p>All testimony given at this stage is
null and void, and may render the
speaker liable to an action for defamation.
Do not omit to be “sworn”
before speaking.</p>

<p>Should you wish to object to giving
evidence on the grounds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
<p><em>a.</em> That your fee (for expenses and
loss of time) has not been paid
by the solicitor calling you.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> That you are unwilling to pose as
able to give “expert opinions.”</p>

<p><em>c.</em> That you may possibly incriminate
yourself:—</p>
</div>

<p>this is the stage at which you should
say so.</p>

<p>There is now complete emancipation
from “the insanitary oath.” For the
sake of public example you should
decline to “kiss the Book” unless you
have brought a Testament with you.
Insist on your right either to affirm or
to swear by the Scots method.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
<h3><span class="smcap">After Being “Sworn.”</span></h3>

<p>Whatever you say in giving evidence
will not render you open to an action
for slander.</p>

<p>The privilege of a witness under
examination is extended to a witness
making statements to a solicitor preparing
his “proof.”</p>

<p>State your full name and address.
Then say, “I am a registered medical
practitioner”; your exact qualifications
are immaterial.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Giving Medical Evidence.</span></h3>

<p class="center">(<em>Cf. Reports, p. 24.</em>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is matter in manner.” “Tell the truth,
and make the truth tell.” “Be the plainest man
in the world in the witness box.” “All trifles are
not trifling.” “Pathology creates the doctor, as
distinct from the nurse.”</p>
</div>


<p><em>The Manner.</em></p>

<p>Listen to the <b>whole question</b> before
you attempt to reply: then answer only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
what is asked. Make yourself understood.</p>

<p>Don’t assume that the jury know all
about the case.</p>

<p>Speak audibly, slowly, deliberately,
with an eye on the recording clerk’s pen.</p>

<p>Say <b>exactly</b> what you mean.</p>

<p>Cultivate the power of expression and
of repression.</p>

<p>Be candid, courteous, dignified, and
withal good humoured; <b>avoid</b> appearing
to be suspicious.</p>

<p>Your <b>personal</b> disposition will count
more with a jury than your professional
position; they will note looks, doubts,
hesitations, confidence, calmness, consideration,
or precipitancy.</p>

<p>Use <b>simple</b> and popular <b>terms</b>,
otherwise you may be regarded as
speaking “either oracles or jargon.”
Reserve technicalities for cross-examination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
The jury will think they understand
“alcoholic disease of the ...,”
“bad disorder,” “black and blue,”
“black-eye,” “blood clot,” “blood
poisoning,” “bowel,” “brain fever,”
“bruise,” “buoyant lungs,” “cancer,”
“consumptive spots,” “coverings of the
brain,” “death stiffening,” “great
vessel of the heart,” “gullet,” “gut,”
“hardened liver,” “hardening of
valves,” “inflammation or congestion
of the ...,” “overloaded with fat,”
“shrunken kidneys,” “skull-cap,”
“stroke,” “swallow,” “sweet-bread,”
“windpipes.”</p>

<p>Don’t worry about the <b>technical
rules</b> of evidence; in the Coroner’s
Court they are seldom applied strictly.</p>

<p>Insist on answering double-barrelled
questions “<b>Yes</b> <span class="allsmcap">AND</span> <b>No</b>” if necessary.</p>

<p>Do not argue with Counsel; “disagree
without being disagreeable.” “A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
large experience is not all experience,”
and what you call “a rare case” may
reflect upon your limited experience.</p>

<p>An early “I <b>don’t</b> know” is better
than a late “I <b>did not</b> know.” If you
“don’t know,” do not be trapped into
guessing. Beware of “argumentative
figures.”</p>


<p><em>The Matter.</em></p>

<p>If unable to decide as to the cause of
death without a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> examination,
tell the jury so at once; the most
experienced pathologist will do so the
most often. Thus you may tell them,
by way of apology, that any organ of
the body may be ruptured without
external signs of injury being apparent.</p>

<p>Distinguish <b>what you have been
told</b> from what you have found by
personal examination.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the facts differs from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
a knowledge of the records of those
facts.</p>

<p>State what you <b>knew professionally</b>
as to the health and the habits of the
deceased, but do not condescend to
detail; it is sufficient to say, “I treated
him,” or “I prescribed;” you need not
specify <b>how</b> unless required so to do.</p>

<p>Don’t offer any explanations unless
directly asked; decline to give “expert
opinion” testimony unless you feel fully
competent so to do.</p>

<p>The jury value evidence by the exactness
of statement of, and the powers of
observation evidenced by, a witness.
Little benefit is gained by cross-examining
one who is obviously telling the
plain truth.</p>

<p>Don’t exaggerate or estimate—“blessed
are the pure in fact” in a law court;
in measurements and descriptions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
be accurate, quoting figures where
possible.</p>

<p>You must answer <b>all questions</b> put
to you, excepting such as would tend to
incriminate yourself; before you answer
such questions, the Coroner must warn
you of the possible legal consequences if
you answer.</p>

<p>There are no medical secrets which
may be kept between a patient and his
medical adviser when they are probed
in a court of law: if, however, you
strongly object to answer, appeal to the
President of the Court, or answer in
writing.</p>

<p>Think twice before adversely criticizing
the actions of another medical
man; remember, <b>symptoms and signs
may alter</b> from day to day.</p>

<p>You may not quote text-books of
living authors, but you may say what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
authors support your view.</p>

<p>If a text-book is quoted for or against
you, <b>strictly verify</b> the text, the context,
and the date of publication, before
affirming or denying the quotation.</p>

<p>After giving evidence, hand in the
labelled and numbered <b>exhibits</b> which
have been handed to you by the police
or found by yourself. “Real evidence”
is, however, capable of fallacious handling,
e.g., “Here’s the note! I made it
at the time!”—but <em>did</em> you?</p>

<p>It may be wise to take an “anatomical”
skull into court for illustration.</p>

<p>The body of the Coroner’s officer is
always available for ocular <b>demonstrations</b>
to the jury of the sites of injuries,
etc.</p>

<p>If any important point has been
omitted by the questions (e.g., of a
non-medical Coroner), volunteer the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
undisclosed information which you
possess.</p>

<p>In conclusion, state the probable <b>cause
of death</b>, especially assuring the jury
if it was, in your opinion, natural; and
if it could have been retarded by efficient
medical advice.</p>

<p>Beware of being didactic on non-medical
matters; such action is a
fruitful source of the “differences of
doctors.”</p>

<p>Before leaving the witness-box, <b>compliment</b>
the conduct of the police or
other persons who rendered worthy
“first aid” to the deceased man.</p>

<p>“The best brief is a copy of the
depositions.” When criminal or civil
proceedings are likely to follow an
inquest, carefully read over and correct
where necessary your depositions as
taken down by the Coroner’s clerk;
initial any alterations you make, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
sign them as a correct record. Never
sign any statement without having
perused it previously.</p>

<p>You can thus readily <em>identify the
depositions</em> later, when you may have
to repeat your evidence in a higher
Court where counsel will have scrutinized
minutely not only the <em>facts stated</em>
but also the <em>facts as stated</em>: and so
will be able to criticize keenly your
second version.</p>

<p>In criminal cases the Coroner will
<em>bind over</em> the medical witness by
recognizance to appear at the trial and
give evidence; usually such cases are
taken first at the Assizes.</p>

<p>Where the authorities <b>compel

definite fees are scheduled: if you
appear on behalf of the prisoner, the
plaintiff, or the defendant, a <b>private
arrangement as to fees</b> (preferably

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
<h3><b>1. THE CORONER’S COURT.</b></h3>

<p>There is <b>no fee</b> allowed for the <b>preliminary
enquiry</b> and report to the
Coroner; he can allow a fee only at an
inquest.</p>

<p>No fee will be paid for an unordered
anatomical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> examination.</p>

<p><b>Only one</b> medical witness is called
by the Coroner; additional evidence
may be ordered by the inquest jury.</p>

<p>A second fee is <b>not allowed</b> for
attendance at an adjournment.</p>

<p>A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> examination must <b>not
be conducted</b> by one accused on oath
of negligently causing the death in
question.</p>

<p>No fee, for evidence or for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i>
examination, is payable to the medical
officers (even if honorary) of voluntary
medical institutions where the deceased
died under the care of the officer; his
attendance may, however, be excused if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
he sends a certificate as to the facts to
the Court.</p>

<p><em>No fee allowed</em>: Lunatic Asylum;
Public Hospital or Infirmary (including
Cottage Hospitals).</p>

<p><em>Fee usually allowed</em>: Prison; Parochial
Infirmary.</p>

<p>Where the deceased was “brought in
dead,” the usual fees may be claimed
by medical officers of institutions.</p>

<p>Travelling expenses seldom can be
due to medical witnesses at inquests.</p>

<p>In <b>criminal cases</b> the Treasury
may send down recognized experts.</p>

<p><em>Fees</em>: For giving medical evidence
after inspecting the body: <span class="allsmcap">ONE GUINEA</span>.</p>

<p>For giving evidence after performing

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
<p><em>Fine</em>: <span class="allsmcap">FIVE POUNDS</span> is the penalty
for disobeying the Coroner’s instructions.</p>


<h3><b>2. CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS.</b></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</i> Home Office Order as to allowances for
professional evidence in criminal prosecutions,
1903.)</p>
</div>

<p>For common skilled witnesses in petty
sessional and police courts, at quarter
sessions, and at the assizes, certain
maximum <b>allowances</b> are specified; it
is left to the Clerk of the Court to decide
the actual fee in each case.</p>

<p>For <b>expert</b> testimony or highly
skilled evidence the fee rests with the
Court or the Treasury.</p>

<p>For attending to give professional
evidence <b>in the town</b> or place where
the witness resides or practises: If the
witness</p>

<p>1. Attends to give evidence in one
case only, not more than <b>one guinea</b>
per diem, even if a disagreeable examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
has been necessary in order to
qualify as a witness.</p>

<p>2. Gives evidence on the same day in
two or more separate and distinct cases,
not more than <b>two guineas</b>.</p>

<p>For attending <b>elsewhere</b> than in any
town or place where the witness resides
or practises, whether in one or more
cases, not more than <b>two guineas</b>
per diem. “Place” here means the
area within a radius of three miles from
the Court.</p>

<p>No full-day allowance shall be paid
unless the witness is necessarily detained
away from his home for <b>at least four
hours</b> for the purpose of giving evidence,
otherwise he shall receive not more
than one-half of the full-day allowance.</p>

<p>The fare actually paid is usually
allowed to a witness as travelling expenses.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
<p>A medical witness, while staying
within the precincts of the Court, may
be ordered to assist with his professional
services.</p>

<p>In case of dispute, the Home Secretary,
Whitehall, S.W., should be applied
to forthwith.</p>


<h3><b>3. CIVIL ACTIONS.</b></h3>

<p>If your services are required by <b>one
party</b> to a suit, it is for you to arrange
terms; the solicitor is not himself
liable. <b>A guinea</b> per diem usually is
regarded as the minimum fee; travelling
expenses (which should be paid in
cash previous to the journey) are
additional.</p>

<p>You can <b>demand</b> payment (in Court)
before you consent to be “sworn” as a
witness; having been “sworn” you are
bound to give your evidence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III_SOME_LIMITATIONS_TO">III. SOME LIMITATIONS TO
MEDICO-LEGAL EVIDENCE.</h2>
</div>


<h3><b>1. IMPOSED BY RULES OF
EVIDENCE.</b></h3>

<p>A medical witness, <b>as such</b>, cannot
give evidence which will influence the
Court to show</p>

<p>1. That a woman is past the age for
procreating and bearing children.</p>

<p>2. That a child born nine months
after lawful wedlock is illegitimate.</p>

<p>3. That, in the absence of eye-witnesses,
a newly-born dead child was
live-born.</p>

<p>4. That in a common disaster a certain
person must have died last.</p>

<p>5. That children under seven can
commit an indictable offence.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
<h3><b>2. IMPOSED BY INADEQUACY AND
UNCERTAINTY OF KNOWLEDGE.</b></h3>

<p>1. The presence of gonorrhœa cannot
be established by microscopical evidence.</p>

<p>2. A small mammalian blood-stain
cannot be sworn to be “human.”</p>

<p>3. In a case of sudden death you
cannot state whether a bruise was
inflicted immediately before or immediately
after the death.</p>

<p>4. The sex of a very old or a very
young skeleton cannot be determined.</p>

<p>5. The age of a skeleton, after complete
ossification, is guess-work.</p>

<p>6. Death cannot be affirmed until
putrefaction sets in.</p>

<p>7. Pregnancy must not be asserted
until quickening has been felt, or the
fœtal parts are palpable.</p>

<p>8. Affiliation to putative parent from
personal resemblance is insufficient.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
<h3><b>3. CASES WHERE
A POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION
IS NECESSARY TO TEST.</b></h3>

<p>1. <em>Alleged Drowning</em>: otherwise in
the absence of eye-witnesses of the
fatality, “found dead in the water” is
the only logical conclusion.</p>

<p>2. <em>Alleged Overlaying</em>: otherwise
“found dead in bed with the parents”
should be the “open verdict.”</p>

<p>In 1 and 2, cardio-respiratory diseases
must be noted.</p>

GENERAL RULE WHICH FORBIDS
THE RECEPTION IN COURTS OF
SUCH TESTIMONY.</h3>


<p>1. The rule is not strictly observed in
the Coroner’s Court, wherein an enquiry,
and not a trial between parties, is held.</p>

<p>2. Formally recorded dying declarations;
the medical adviser often hears
“the last whisper of life.”</p>

are sometimes made to medical
men.</p>

assault, or rape.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI_PRECAUTIONS_TO_BE">VI. PRECAUTIONS TO BE
OBSERVED UNDER SUSPICIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES;</h2>
</div>

<h3>WHICH MAY TERMINATE IN THE
CORONER’S COURT, AND NEED
MEDICAL EVIDENCE.</h3>


<p>The primary duty of a medical man
is to treat every patient <em>as a patient</em>.</p>


<p><b>1. Chronic or slow poisoning</b>
(including alcoholic).</p>

<p><em>Cautions.</em> Try all possible preventive
means before announcing the suspicion;
do not move until your ground is quite
sure: otherwise an action for defamation
of character may result.</p>

<p>The family medical man must not be
misled by the suspicions of weak-minded
or alcoholic patients; he must exclude
every possibility of an accidental origin
of the symptoms. He should know the
several personalities of his patient’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
families.</p>

<p>The symptoms may appear during
medical treatment: poison being substituted
as “a lingering dram.”</p>

<p>If convinced, by repeated examination
of the patient’s food and excreta, by his
symptoms, and by the conduct of the
suspected person, that the influence of
poison is at work, let it be understood
by the patient’s friends that you are not
satisfied with the progress made: suggest
the possibility of an accidental poisoning.
Do not, at present, associate any
name as the culprit; suggest a consultation
with a medical friend.</p>

<p>Have the patient placed under the
constant care of day and night nurses,
who, although being instructed to administer
personally all food and medicine,
need not know at first your suspicions.
If the line of defence is circumvented,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
or is impossible, have the victim removed
to a nursing home, or to a hospital.</p>

<p>Your suspicions, without mentioning
any name, should be told <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i> to
the relatives of the poisoned person, to
his solicitor, or to the suspect himself.
If this course is futile, the name can be
introduced in the information given to
these persons, to the patient himself, or,
finally, to a magistrate, or to the police.
Should the victim die, the Coroner
should be asked to order an expert
toxicological examination of the body of
the deceased.</p>


<p><b>2. Threatened suicide.</b></p>

<p>“There is a rule of life far higher
than professional etiquette—a duty that
every right-minded man owes his neighbour—to
prevent the destruction of
human life.”</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
<p>“Sign an urgency certificate, so that
the patient can be detained in his own
house legally. Any step which is taken,
which is in good faith, with the intention
of certifying, is justified, and is covered
by the law.”</p>


<p><b>Attempted suicide.</b></p>

<p>Special care must be taken to prevent
a further attempt by constant unobserved
watching. Delirious, melancholic, suicidal,
and mentally defective patients
are preferably placed on the ground
floor.</p>

<p>3. Where a patient dies suddenly
from a cause which is obviously not the
one under treatment—as when anæsthetized,
or after an operation.</p>

<p>Enumerate to the friends the possible
explanations of the fatal issue. Affirm
that there is no reason to have expected
any one of them, and that all the usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
precautions had been taken.</p>

<p>Report to the Coroner, or advise,
where such report is considered unnecessary,
that an anatomical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i>
examination should be conducted for
the satisfaction of all parties concerned.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
